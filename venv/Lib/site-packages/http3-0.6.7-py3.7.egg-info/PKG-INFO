        HTTP3 is a next-generation HTTP client for Python 3.
        
        **Note**: *This project should be considered as an "alpha" release. It is substantially API complete, but there are still some areas that need more work.*
        
        ---
        
        Let's get started...
        
        ```python
        >>> import http3
        >>> r = http3.get('https://www.example.org/')
        >>> r
        <Response [200 OK]>
        >>> r.status_code
        200
        >>> r.protocol
        'HTTP/2'
        >>> r.headers['content-type']
        'text/html; charset=UTF-8'
        >>> r.text
        '<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Example Domain</title>...'
        ```
        
        ## Features
        
        HTTP3 builds on the well-established usability of `requests`, and gives you:
        
        * A requests-compatible API.
        * HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 support.
        * Support for [issuing HTTP requests in parallel](https://www.encode.io/http3/parallel/). *(Coming soon)*
        * Standard synchronous interface, but [with `async`/`await` support if you need it](https://www.encode.io/http3/async/).
        * Ability to [make requests directly to WSGI or ASGI applications](https://www.encode.io/http3/advanced/#calling-into-python-web-apps).
        * Strict timeouts everywhere.
        * Fully type annotated.
        * 100% test coverage.
        
        Plus all the standard features of `requests`...
        
        * International Domains and URLs
        * Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling
        * Sessions with Cookie Persistence
        * Browser-style SSL Verification
        * Basic/Digest Authentication *(Digest is still TODO)*
        * Elegant Key/Value Cookies
        * Automatic Decompression
        * Automatic Content Decoding
        * Unicode Response Bodies
        * Multipart File Uploads
        * HTTP(S) Proxy Support *(TODO)*
        * Connection Timeouts
        * Streaming Downloads
        * .netrc Support *(TODO)*
        * Chunked Requests
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install with pip:
        
        ```shell
        $ pip install http3
        ```
        
        HTTP3 requires Python 3.6+
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Project documentation is available at [www.encode.io/http3/](https://www.encode.io/http3/).
        
        For a run-through of all the basics, head over to the [QuickStart](https://www.encode.io/http3/quickstart/).
        
        For more advanced topics, see the [Advanced Usage](https://www.encode.io/http3/advanced/) section, or
        the specific topics on making [Parallel Requests](https://www.encode.io/http3/parallel/) or using the
        [Async Client](https://www.encode.io/http3/async/).
        
        The [Developer Interface](https://www.encode.io/http3/api/) provides a comprehensive API reference.
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        The HTTP3 project relies on these excellent libraries:
        
        * `h2` - HTTP/2 support.
        * `h11` - HTTP/1.1 support.
        * `certifi` - SSL certificates.
        * `chardet` - Fallback auto-detection for response encoding.
        * `idna` - Internationalized domain name support.
        * `rfc3986` - URL parsing & normalization.
        * `brotlipy` - Decoding for "brotli" compressed responses. *(Optional)*
        
        A huge amount of credit is due to `requests` for the API layout that
        much of this work follows, as well as to `urllib3` for plenty of design
        inspiration around the lower level networking details.
